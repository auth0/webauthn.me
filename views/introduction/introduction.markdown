## Web Authentication

[Web Authentication](https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-web-authentication/) is a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) for defining an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.

Web Authentication works hand in hand with other industry standards such as [Credential Management Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/) and [FIDO 2.0 Client to Authenticator Protocol 2](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-rd-20170927/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-rd-20170927.html).

## How It Works

These entities work together in two separate use cases: **registration** and **authentication**. All communications between the different entities in the diagram are handled by the user agent (usually a [web browser](/browser-support)).

Registration makes the authenticator create a new set of public-key credentials that can be used to sign a challenge generated by the relying party. The public part of these new credentials, along with the signed challenge, can be sent back to the relying party for storage. The relying party can later use these credentials to verify the identity of a user whenever required.

Authentication, in contrast, allows the relying party to send a challenge to the authenticator. This challenge can then be signed with the previously generated public-key credentials and sent back to the relying party. This way, the relying party can verify that a user is in possession of the required credentials, proving their identity.

There are two types of authenticators. [Roaming authenticators](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/configure-webauthn-security-keys-for-mfa) connect to your devices through USB, Bluetooth or NFC, and [platform authenticators](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/configure-webauthn-device-biometrics-for-mfa) are built in.

While roaming authenticators are widely supported in most modern browsers, platform authenticators support is running a bit behind. [Find out if your current browser supports roaming and platform authenticators](/browser-support).

Both processes work with the help of public-key cryptography and digital signatures. If you are not familiar with how public-key cryptography or digital signatures work, the important thing you need to know is that there is a **public key** and a **private key**.

The private key is secret, and only the user (or the authenticator) need to know it. The public key, in contrast, can be seen or stored by anyone. The public key can be used to verify signatures generated by the private key. No other key, other than the private key, can generate a signature that the public key can verify as valid. This way, the relying party can store a public key and use it to verify signatures performed by the user holding the private key.

## The API

The Web Authentication API has two main calls: `navigator.credentials.create`, and `navigator.credentials.get`.

`create` can be used to perform the registration step. `get` can be used to perform the authentication step.

Here is a sample call of the `create` function inside an EJS template:

```javascript
navigator.credentials
  .create({
    publicKey: {
      // random, cryptographically secure, at least 16 bytes
      challenge: base64url.decode("<%= challenge %>"),
      // relying party
      rp: {
        name: "Awesome Corp", // sample relying party
      },
      user: {
        id: base64url.decode("<%= id %>"),
        name: "<%= name %>",
        displayName: "<%= displayName %>",
      },
      authenticatorSelection: { userVerification: "preferred" },
      attestation: "direct",
      pubKeyCredParams: [
        {
          type: "public-key",
          alg: -7, // "ES256" IANA COSE Algorithms registry
        },
      ],
    },
  })
  .then((res) => {
    var json = publicKeyCredentialToJSON(res);
    // Send data to relying party's servers
    post("/webauthn/register", {
      state: "<%= state %>",
      provider: "<%= provider %>",
      res: JSON.stringify(json),
    });
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

Here is a sample call of the `get` function in an EJS template:

```javascript
navigator.credentials
  .get({
    publicKey: {
      // random, cryptographically secure, at least 16 bytes
      challenge: base64url.decode("<%= challenge %>"),
      allowCredentials: [
        {
          id: base64url.decode("<%= id %>"),
          type: "public-key",
        },
      ],
      timeout: 15000,
      authenticatorSelection: { userVerification: "preferred" },
    },
  })
  .then((res) => {
    var json = publicKeyCredentialToJSON(res);
    // Send data to relying party's servers
    post("/webauthn/authenticate", {
      state: "<%= state %>",
      provider: "<%= provider %>",
      res: JSON.stringify(json),
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    alert("Invalid FIDO device");
  });
```

## Glossary

- **Assertion**: a signed statement returned by the authenticator carrying data sent by the relying party and the client.
- **Attestation**: an operation that conveys the provenance of an authenticator and the data it emits. This operation can also be used to create new credentials.
- **Authentication**: the ceremony where a user, and the user’s computing device(s) (containing at least one authenticator) work in concert to cryptographically prove to a Relying Party that the user controls the credential private key associated with a previously-registered public key credential. Note that this includes a test of user presence or user verification.
- **Authenticator**: a hardware or software device that receives requests from the client to either perform an attestation operation or an assertion operation. It generates public key credentials and associates them with a single user and relying party.
- **Authorization Gesture**: An authorization gesture is a physical interaction performed by a user with an authenticator as part of a ceremony, such as registration or authentication. By making such an authorization gesture, a user provides consent for (i.e., authorizes) a ceremony to proceed. This may involve user verification if the employed authenticator is capable, or it may involve a simple test of user presence.
- **Ceremony**: a group of operations performed in a certain way by a group of entities according to protocols and procedures. These entities can include humans performing actions.
- **Client**: an entity that represents the collaboration between the user, the user agent, and the platform.
- **Credential ID**: A probabilistically-unique byte sequence identifying a public key credential source and its authentication assertions. It may contain encrypted data only readable by the authenticator that created it.
- **Registration**: The ceremony where a user, a Relying Party, and the user’s computing device(s) (containing at least one authenticator) work in concert to create a public key credential and associate it with the user’s Relying Party account. Note that this includes employing a test of user presence or user verification.
- **Relying Party**: the entity that makes use of Web Authentication to authenticate a user (for example: Auth0, Facebook, Google).
