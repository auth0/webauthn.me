Web Authentication is a new standard enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users using hardware authenticators.

[WebAuthn.me](https://webauthn.me) contains a visual walkthrough of each step of the process of registering new credentials and authenticating using these credentials. There's also a debugger to play around with different configurations and an introduction page with some more information.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
- Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
